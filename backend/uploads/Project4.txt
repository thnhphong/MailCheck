SSL Server and Browser Tests
Over view: Testing the security of web servers and local web by using tools such as Qualys SSL Labs.
Content: Testing a highly rated website's SSL configuration, then switch to a poorly rated website, comparing the security of two different web browsers.
Key: 
Use SSL Lab's SSL Server Test to test good and bad websites.
Review overall ratings, focus on elements such as Certificate, Protocol Support, Key Exchange, and Cipher Strength.
Understand how handshake simulation work, showing how browsers negotiate security parameters with the server.
Analyze the order and type of cipher suites supported, consider more secure cipher suites need to be prioritized.
Evaluate and compare the security configurations of web browsers, determine which has better projection.
Outcomes: 
Practical skills in accessing SSL/TLS configuration of web servers.
Identify security vulnerabilities: outdated protocols or weak cipher suites.
Build a prioritized action plan for improving server and browser security.
